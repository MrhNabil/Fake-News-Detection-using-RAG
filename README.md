# 📰 Fake News Detection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project demonstrates how to use **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to detect and analyze potential fake news.
It combines a **retriever** (for factual grounding) with a **large language model (LLM)** (for reasoning) to evaluate whether a given news article or snippet is reliable.

---

## 📌 Features

* Preprocessing and embedding of news articles
* Vector database for semantic retrieval
* Integration with a Large Language Model (LLM)
* End-to-end Fake News Detection pipeline using RAG
* Example queries with explanations

---

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses a dataset of news articles (fake and real).
The text is preprocessed, cleaned, and embedded into a vector space for retrieval.

👉 You can adapt the pipeline to your own dataset by replacing the preprocessing section in the notebook.

---

## 🔎 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and prepare raw text.
2. **Embedding Generation** – Convert articles into embeddings for semantic similarity.
3. **Retriever Setup** – Store embeddings in a vector database for fast lookups.
4. **RAG Pipeline** – Combine retriever with LLM for fact-grounded classification and explanation.
5. **Evaluation** – Run example queries to test the system.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection-rag.git
cd fake-news-detection-rag
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

1. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Fake_News_Detection_RAG.ipynb
```

2. Replace the placeholder API key section with your own credentials (if required).
3. Run the cells step by step to reproduce the pipeline.

---

## ✅ Example Output

The pipeline takes a piece of text, retrieves relevant context from the dataset, and asks the LLM to classify and explain whether the text is likely **real or fake**.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion & Future Work

This project shows the potential of RAG in combating misinformation.
Future work may include:

* Expanding to larger and multilingual datasets
* Fine-tuning LLMs on fake news corpora
* Using multiple retriever sources for broader factual grounding
